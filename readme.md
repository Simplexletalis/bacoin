This is a proposed contract collection for an ERC20 (Standard) token called Bacoin.

Bacoin will have 8460150 (BACOIN) Tokens distrubuted amongst all of the AirDrop participants -15% for development, marketing and other causes. The goal is to become a token of value in relation to the price of Bacon in the meat industry (about $.42 USD per slice or so based on 16oz @ $6).

Eventually, Bacoin would like to be a token to enable bacon rewards program for franchise fast food chains, restaurants, butcher shops and Pork Producers within the meat industry.
